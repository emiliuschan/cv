        <hr>
        <p>I'm just an 18 year old lad working on developing a website and discord bots! I've been very fascinated in programming. So far, I've done Python, JS, and HTML!</p>
        <p>I've worked on Game development as well, but didn't get very far. I hope to continue it in the near future!</p>
        <p>I do art/animation as well! My commissions are currently open, and is expanding as time goes on.</p>
